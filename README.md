NetEvo - Complex Dynamical Network Evolution
============================================

NetEvo is a computing framework designed to allow researchers to investigate 
evolutionary aspects of dynamical complex networks. By providing tools to 
easily integrate each of these factors in a coherent way, it is hoped a 
greater understanding can be gained of key attributes and features displayed 
by complex systems.
